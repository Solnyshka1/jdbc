Employee Management System (JavaFX)
This is an Employee Management System that allows users to manage a list of employees. The system lets users:

View employees' details in a table.
Add new employees.
Calculate and show salaries based on employee types.
Remove employees from the list.
The application uses JavaFX for the graphical user interface (GUI) and follows object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

Using the Application:
After running the program, a window will appear with a table showing employee details.
You can add employees by entering their name, type (Full-time, Part-time, or Contractor), salary or hourly rate, and hours worked.
The salary will be calculated and displayed in the table.
To remove an employee, simply select their row in the table and click the "Remove Selected" button.
